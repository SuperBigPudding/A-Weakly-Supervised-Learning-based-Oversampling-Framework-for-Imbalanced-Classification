# A-Weakly-Supervised-Learning-based-Oversampling-Framework-for-Imbalanced-Classification
This is a program of a new weakly supervised learning based oversampling framework to solve the imbalanced classification proposed by Min Qian and Yanfu Li.

In this program, a weakly supervised oversampling method is developed and applied to improve the credibility of synthetic samplesâ€™ labels. At the same time, to better solve multi-dimensional problems and highly imbalanced problems in class imbalance, we introduced cost-sensitive neighborhood components analysis (CS-NCA) for dimensionality reduction and boosting-based ensemble framework (BEF) for reducing imbalanced ratio.

The proposed method is a good choice for highly imbalanced and high dimensional data classification.
